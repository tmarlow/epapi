This is the organizing document for developing an R package for interacting with the EPA restful data API.  There are a few things I am interested now in beginning to look up. 


* Useful Websites:

URL for API: https://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/efservice/

https://www.r-bloggers.com/accessing-apis-from-r-and-a-little-r-programming/ this is a useful introduction to working with APIs in R 


* TODO get familiar with the EPA api 
** TODO How are the tables set up? 
- this website provides a pretty good overview of the different datasets.

** DONE can we access previous years? This is crucial
- yes. Haven't Figured out how to do that from the API yet though. 
- reporting year is probably in Form R 

** TODO can we successfully use the dataset? 


I think the best approach is to focus on one database at a time and add a function for accessing each. Then at the end we can combine them all into one meta-function. 

* TODO How do you use an api from R? 

* TODO Look at the source code for other api packages. 
** TODO what are common functions? 
** TODO features? 
** TODO what kinds of error messages do they provide? 

* What do I actually need? 

** TODO TRI data for Rhode Island - all years 
** TODO ACRES data for Rhode Island - all years
** TODO FRS data for Rhode Island - all years
