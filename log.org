This is the organizing document for developing an R package for interacting with the EPA restful data API.  There are a few things I am interested now in beginning to look up. 


* Useful Websites: 
https://www.epa.gov/enviro/envirofacts-data-service-api

URL for API: https://iaspub.epa.gov/enviro/efservice/

https://www.epa.gov/enviro/about-data

https://www.r-bloggers.com/accessing-apis-from-r-and-a-little-r-programming/ this is a useful introduction to working with APIs in R 


* DONE get familiar with the EPA api 
** DONE How are the tables set up? 
- this website provides a pretty good overview of the different datasets.

** DONE can we access previous years? This is crucial
- yes. Haven't Figured out how to do that from the API yet though. 
- reporting year is probably in Form R 

** DONE can we successfully use the dataset? 
Yep In the file test_function.R I successfully downloaded RI TRI data from 2015. 

I think the best approach is to focus on one database at a time and add a function for accessing each. Then at the end we can combine them all into one meta-function. 

* DONE How do you use an api from R?

* DONE How do I access particular years from EPA API? 
I emailed the EPA and the responded: 

You can specify the reporting year with requests to the data API as long as the REPORTING_YEAR column is included in a table that is part of your API request. The REPORTING_YEAR  metadata page at https://oaspub.epa.gov/enviro/EF_METADATA_HTML.tri_page?p_column_name=REPORTING_YEAR shows the tables that include REPORTING_YEAR which are the following:

TRI_FACILITY_NAICS_HISTORY
TRI_FACILITY_NPDES_HISTORY
TRI_FACILITY_DB_HISTORY
TRI_FACILITY_RCRA_HISTORY
TRI_FACILITY_HISTORY
TRI_FORM_R_FACILITY
TRI_REPORTING_FORM
TRI_FACILITY_SIC_HISTORY
TRI_FACILITY_UIC_HISTORY
The default output is "=" and does not require an operator when searching for a specific year, but you can enter "<", " >" to get a range of anything prior to or after an entered year.


* What do I actually need? 

** TODO TRI data for Rhode Island - all years
- TODO now I need to link TRI_facility_ID to FORM_R that has all the release

**** TODO select only the id, reporting year
**** TODO download facility data again. or form_R that has releases

 
** TODO ACRES data for Rhode Island - all years
** TODO FRS data for Rhode Island - all years 


* TODO Look at the source code for other api packages. 
** TODO what are common functions? 
** TODO features? 
** TODO what kinds of error messages do they provide?
